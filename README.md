# Black Lives Matter's Effect on Police Lethal Use-of-Force
Welcome to the GitHub repository for replicating the research conducted by [Campbell (2023)](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3767097) *Black Lives Matter's Effect on Police Lethal Use of Force*. This repository provides replication data and Stata code necessary to reproduce the analysis.

To explore the research findings, refer to the "Master.do" do-file, which serves as a table of contents for each step in the analysis. The analysis was performed using Stata 17. The primary dataset used in the analysis is titled "stacked.dta".

While the source data utilized in the analysis are publicly available, certain data sources cannot be openly shared due to data use agreements. Consequently, the replication data only includes the aggregated datasets created specifically for this analysis, based on census place-level information. Therefore, if you choose to replicate the study, please proceed to line 100 of the "Master.do" do-file, unless you decide to download the source files and agree to their respective data use agreements.

If you have any questions or require assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

# BLack Lives Matter Protests Data

For researchers who are interested in studying Black Lives Matter protests at a census place level, I have also included the daily protests dataset spanning 2014-2021.

The file is called "protest_daily.dta" and includes the state, city name, census place FIPS code, and date of the protests. The dataset also includes a variable "protest_s" that indicates solidarity protests (rallies that protest an incident that occurred in another city).

# Black Lives Matter's Effect on Police Lethal Use-of-Froce
Replication data and Stata code for [Campbell (2021)](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3767097) *Black Lives Matter's Effect on Police Lethal Use-of-Force*. 

The "Master.do" do-file reports each step of the analysis. The anlysis was carried out on Stata 16. 

While all of the source data used in the analysis is publically availible, some of the sources cannot be shared; they require users to agree to a data use agreement. Hence, the replication data only includes the constructed datasets used for the analysis (census place level aggregates). For this reason, any replication will need to skip to line 100 of the "Master.do" do-file.
